#### Caring for Aging Parents: Health Effects of Division of Care Between Siblings

Fall 2019. An individual research project for my term paper in _14.33 Research and Communication in Economics_ at MIT. Supervised by David Atkin.


_Abstract:_ This paper uses an IV strategy to test the hypothesis that the division of care-giving for aging parents between their sons and daughters influences parental health outcomes beyond the impact of the total amount of care provided. The results suggest that having a larger share of care provided by daughters is associated with more diagnosed conditions and worse mental health, but also show that the impact of care division on many other health outcomes is minimal or inconclusive. This paper fills gaps in the
literature on health determinants of aging Americans and gender division of non-market labor.
